# ZGLOOM

A re-implementation of Amiga FPS Gloom

# INSTRUCTIONS

## Windows

Drop everything in the bin folder in the root of Gloom (ie, above the misc/, pics/ etc dirs). Run the -zm exe for Zombie Massacre as that game moves some files around. 
Will need the VS2013 runtime.

## Linux

1. Install libSDL2, libSDL2_mixer and libXMP.
2. Compile with `make`.

# CONTROLS
Cursors, left alt to strafe, left ctrl to fire. F1 skips level. F12 toggles fullscreen. PrintScreen dumps a bitmap.

# TODO
-Backend of the renderer is mostly mine, and is flaky. There's Z-fighting that doesn't exist in the original, for instance
-Object scaling not done
-Key repeat on fire needs adding
-Weapons reset on new level
-Sound is deafening on occasion, need variable volume playback and priority system
-Many monsters are missing their logic still
-No HUD and no way to actually die yet
-Crashes on game complete
-No title screen yet
-No blood effects
-No spark effects
-LibXMP's MED playback isn't great on some tunes

# LICENSE
Dunno. The Gloom source release says only the .s and .bb2 files are open source, but the Gloom executable bakes in some maths lookup tables (but then, they are generated by the .bb2 files), bullet and sparks graphics, and 
the title screen for Classic Gloom. I probably won't add the latter and just display the Black Magic image, or something.
